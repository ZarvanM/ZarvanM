Hi, I'm Zarvan Movdawalla, an undergrad engineering student at MPSTME Mumbai, India.
My aim is to make aerospace and avionics code and hardware more accessible, by reducing the inherent learning and cost curve for such endeavors.

Leading Team MPSTME-AeroXperts (Multirotor UAVs) and Team MPSTME-ASLS (Air, Sea, Land, Space).
